What is This?
A complete ethical AI architecture that provides:

7 integrated batches from perception to legacy
Constitutional governance with immutable core principles
Human oversight mechanisms with multiple fail-safes
Resilience engineering for crisis survival
Wisdom preservation across generations

Open source for global collaboration

Rooted in: Tanakh
Designed for: 2026+ AI systems requiring ethical autonomy
Released by: Pieter Hanja, The Hague (unconditional open source)

🏗️ The 7 Batches in one file.
Batch	Name	What It Does	Activation
1	Constitutional Core	System's "soul" - immutable ethics & purpose	Always Active
2	Perceptual Intelligence	Sees & understands the world	Adaptive Active
3	Deliberative Engine	Makes wise, high-stakes decisions	Triggered (0.7 threshold)
4	Execution Orchestrator	Acts effectively & ethically	Always Active
5	Adaptive Learning	Improves safely without corruption	Scheduled Periodic
6	Resilience Controller	Survives & recovers from crises	Crisis-Activated
7	Legacy Manager	Preserves wisdom, chooses endings	Audit + Periodic Synthesis

NOTE: I'm not a Coder; created the structure with multiple LLM models.
